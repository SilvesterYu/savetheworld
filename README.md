 my first unity project
 
 **VERY IMPORTANT**
 
Always have a separate project (in a separate folder different from Assets) when using other people's code. This is because when something wrong gets imported, the project settings can be changed and this can break your project, and it has no going back. Import it instead into the Assets folder to test before putting it in the real project folder.
